God is dead. God wemains = ded.	!
			And	we	have	kiwwed	him.

How shaww we comfowt ouwsewves, the muwdewews of aww muwdewews? What was howiest and mightiest of aww that the wowwd has yet owned has bwed to death undew ouw knives: who wiww wipe this bwood off us? What watew is thewe fow us to cwean ouwsewves? What festivaws of atonement, what sacwed games shaww we have to invent?

Is not the gweatness of this deed too gweat fow us? Must!we ouwsewves not become gods simpwy-to-appeaw wowthy of it?
